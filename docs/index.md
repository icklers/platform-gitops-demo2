# Welcome to the Crossplane GitOps Tutorial

This tutorial is designed for Senior DevOps Engineers who want to master the art of building and managing cloud infrastructure using a GitOps workflow, powered by Crossplane and ArgoCD.

We will move beyond simple examples and dive deep into building a robust, production-ready Internal Developer Platform (IDP). You will learn how to manage infrastructure for multiple cloud providers, enforce security policies, and create a self-service ecosystem for your development teams.

## What You Will Learn

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Crossplane:** Define, compose, and manage your cloud resources (like Kubernetes clusters, databases, and networking) directly from Kubernetes YAML.
- **GitOps with ArgoCD:** Use Git as the single source of truth for both your infrastructure and application deployments.
- **Multi-Cloud Provisioning:** Learn to provision and manage resources across Azure, Hetzner, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- **Production-Ready Patterns:** Implement best practices for security, observability, and repository management.
- **Platform Engineering:** Build a true self-service platform that empowers developers to provision the resources they need, when they need them.

## Prerequisites

This is an advanced course. We assume you have a strong, hands-on understanding of:

- **Kubernetes:** You should be comfortable with `kubectl`, Kubernetes objects (Deployments, Services, etc.), and general cluster administration.
- **Docker:** You should know how to build, run, and manage Docker containers.
- **Git:** You should be proficient with core Git commands, branching, and pull requests.
- **General Cloud Concepts:** You should understand basic concepts like VPCs, subnets, and IAM roles.
